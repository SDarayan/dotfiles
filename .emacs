;; ===== Set the highlight current line minor mode ===== 

;; In every buffer, the line which contains the cursor will be fully
;; highlighted
(global-hl-line-mode 1)

;; ===== Set standard indent to 4 ====
(setq standard-indent 4)

;; ========== Line by line scrolling ========== 

;; This makes the buffer scroll by only a single line when the up or
;; down cursor keys push the cursor (tool-bar-mode) outside the
;; buffer. The standard emacs behaviour is to reposition the cursor in
;; the center of the screen, but this can make the scrolling confusing
(setq scroll-step 1)

;; ===== Turn off tab character =====

;;
;; Emacs normally uses both tabs and spaces to indent lines. If you
;; prefer, all indentation can be made from spaces only. To request this,
;; set `indent-tabs-mode' to `nil'. This is a per-buffer variable;
;; altering the variable affects only the current buffer, but it can be
;; disabled for all buffers.

;;
;; Use (setq ...) to set value locally to a buffer
;; Use (setq-default ...) to set value globally 
;;
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

;; ========== Place Backup Files in Specific Directory ==========

;; Enable backup files.

;; Enable versioning with default values (keep five last versions, I think!)
(setq version-control t)

;; Save all backup file in this directory.
(setq backup-directory-alist (quote ((".*" . "~/.emacs_backups/"))))

;; ========== Enable Line and Column Numbering ==========

;; Show line-number in the mode line
(line-number-mode 1)

;; Show column-number in the mode line
(column-number-mode 1)

;; ========== Enable global copy-paste ==========
(setq x-select-enable-clipboard t)

;; ========== Set the fill column ==========

;; Enable backup files.
(setq-default fill-column 72)

;; ===== Turn on Auto Fill mode automatically in all modes =====

;; Auto-fill-mode the the automatic wrapping of lines and insertion of
;; newlines when the cursor goes over the column limit.

;; This should actually turn on auto-fill-mode by default in all major
;; modes. The other way to do this is to turn on the fill for specific modes
;; via hooks.
(setq auto-fill-mode 1)

;; ===== Make Text mode the default mode for new buffers =====
(setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)

;; ========= Set colours ==========

;; Set cursor and mouse-pointer colours
(set-cursor-color "red")
(set-mouse-color "blue")

;; Set region background colour
(set-face-background 'region "goldenrod")

;; Set emacs background colour
(set-background-color "black")

;; ===== Function to delete a line =====

;; First define a variable which will store the previous column position
(defvar previous-column nil "Save the column position")

;; Define the nuke-line function. The line is killed, then the newline
;; character is deleted. The column which the cursor was positioned at is then
;; restored. Because the kill-line function is used, the contents deleted can
;; be later restored by usibackward-delete-char-untabifyng the yank commands.
(defun nuke-line()
  "Kill an entire line, including the trailing newline character"
  (interactive)

  ;; Store the current column position, so it can later be restored for a more
  ;; natural feel to the deletion
  (setq previous-column (current-column))

  ;; Now move to the end of the current line
  (end-of-line)

  ;; Test the length of the line. If it is 0, there is no need for a
  ;; kill-line. All that happens in this case is that the new-line character
  ;; is deleted.
  (if (= (current-column) 0)
    (delete-char 1)

    ;; This is the 'else' clause. The current line being deleted is not zero
    ;; in length. First remove the line by moving to its start and then
    ;; killing, followed by deletion of the newline character, and then
    ;; finally restoration of the column position.
    (progn
      (beginning-of-line)
      (kill-line)
      (delete-char 1)
      (move-to-column previous-column))))

;; Now bind the delete line function to the F8 key
(global-set-key (kbd "M-d") 'nuke-line)

;; ===== Packages =====
(load "~/.emacs.d/my-loadpackages.el")
